SQL Challenge

Data Modeling

- We began this project by observing the CSVs that were provided and sketvhing out an ERD of tables that could be created using the data
- This allowed us to see what Primary and Foreign Keys would be needed in order to create our data tables later on

Data Engineering

- Tables were created using the ERD making use the proper data types, primary keys, foreign keys
- CSVs were imported into their corresponding SQL table

Data Analysis

- Once the data wa imported we were asked to use the data to extract the following:
  - The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee
  - The first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986
  - The manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name
  - The department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name
  - The first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B
  - Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
  - Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
  - The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names
